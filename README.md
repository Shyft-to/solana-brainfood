Your weekly dose of Solana dev content, tutorials, code walkthroughs and much more. Bite sized content to juice up your Solana IQ.  
Learn how to do this that and what not on Solana, with a step-by-step guide on how it was built and open source code for you to reuse.  
Not just this, we are also building video walkthroughs and maybe, just maybe airdropping it to your nearest wallet as a cNFT (just maybe, ok).  

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8JyZCjRPmr) is where we discuss all the dev stuff 

What's your excuse for not building on Solana again?
